### Step-by-step flow with technical details

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - `ParticleUniversalAccount.tsx` renders sign-in options. On mainnet the user connects **MetaMask** via `ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum)`; on testnet the user signs in with a **ZeroDev EIP-7702** session key stored locally.
   - "Sign in with Particle Web3 Login" dynamically imports `@particle-network/auth` (`ParticleNetwork`) and `@particle-network/provider` (`ParticleProvider`). `particle.auth.logout()` is called before `particle.auth.login({ supportAuthTypes: 'email,google,apple,twitter,discord' })` to force the Particle modal to appear, then the Particle EIP-1193 provider is bound to `window.ethereum` so the rest of the app continues to use standard `eth_sendTransaction` calls.

2. **Universal Account bootstrap**
   - `@particle-network/universal-account-sdk` (`UniversalAccount`) is instantiated with the connected signer inside `ParticleUniversalAccount.tsx`. This exposes `ua.createExecuteTransaction()`, `ua.createUniversalTransaction()`, `ua.createTransferTransaction()` and balance helpers used across the app.
   - The ZeroDev **kernel client** is built from `@zerodev/sdk` (`createKernelAccount`, `createKernelAccountClient`) with `@zerodev/ecdsa-validator` (`signerToEcdsaValidator`) using an internally generated EIP-7702 signer for testnet interactions.

3. **Pay & Split (atomic batching)**
   - Shared: decimals normalised via `toBaseUnits` / `formatBaseUnits` in `src/lib/amounts.ts` (BigInt) to avoid `viem` / `ethers` scientific-notation errors.
   - **Testnet (Arbitrum Sepolia):** multi-recipient splits batched with `ua.createExecuteTransaction({ transactions: [...] })`; single-recipient sends use raw `eth_sendTransaction` from the 7702 key so they show in Arbiscan's **Transactions** tab.
   - **Mainnet (Arbitrum One):** cross-chain sourcing via `ua.createUniversalTransaction({ expectTokens: [{ type, amount, chainId }] })`, so the payer needs no Arbitrum liquidity.

4. **Receive Payments (QR + payer route)**
   - Shared: `src/lib/payment-requests.ts` stores `{ recipient, token, amount, chainId, requestId }` in Supabase; `qrcode.react` renders a QR deep-linking to `/pay/:requestId` (`src/routes/pay.$requestId.tsx`).
   - **Testnet:** payer route encodes ERC-20 `transfer(address,uint256)` calldata manually and submits via `window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_sendTransaction' })` (bypasses ethers *"could not coalesce error"*).
   - **Mainnet:** same `eth_sendTransaction` path on Arbitrum One; ETH requests send value directly, USDC requests hits address.

5. **Tourist Packages**
   - **Testnet:** package price is charged directly from the 7702 smart account to the Platform Treasury via `eth_sendTransaction` (ETH) or an encoded USDC `transfer`.
   - **Mainnet:** uses `@zerodev/smart-routing-address` → `createSmartRoutingAddress({ tokenType: 'ERC20' | 'NATIVE', chain: arbitrum, sourceTokens: [Optimism, Base, Ethereum], allowPartialRoutes: true, recipient: 0x24A1…48Fb })`. The returned address is rendered as a QR; deposits are auto-bridged and delivered on Arbitrum One.

6. **Activity + Treasury balances**
   - **Testnet:** `src/lib/activity-tracker.ts` writes to `DAppActivityTracker.sol` using manually-encoded selectors + 40% gas pad through `eth_sendTransaction` (avoids 7702 estimation bugs).
   - **Mainnet:** a polling `useEffect` in `ParticleUniversalAccount.tsx` reads ETH (`eth_getBalance`) and USDC (`balanceOf` via `eth_call`) on Arbitrum One and converts to USD via the CoinGecko price API.

# Tech Stack

### Core framework
- **TanStack Start v1 + React 19 + TypeScript** — SSR-capable full-stack framework with file-based routing under `src/routes/`.
- **Vite 7** — build tool; TanStack Router Vite plugin auto-generates `routeTree.gen.ts`.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — configured via `src/styles.css` using native `@theme` variables (no `tailwind.config.js`).
- **shadcn/ui + Radix UI** — accessible headless components used throughout the dashboard.

### Wallet & Account Abstraction
- **`@particle-network/universal-account-sdk`** — powers `UniversalAccount`, `createExecuteTransaction` (atomic 7702 batching), `createUniversalTransaction` (cross-chain sourcing with `expectTokens`), `createTransferTransaction` (single-asset fallback), and unified balance queries.
- **`@particle-network/auth` + `@particle-network/provider`** — Web3 login modal (email / Google / Apple / Twitter / Discord) and the EIP-1193 provider bridged onto `window.ethereum`.
- **`@zerodev/sdk`** — `createKernelAccount` + `createKernelAccountClient` build the smart account; sponsored gas via ZeroDev paymaster.
- **`@zerodev/ecdsa-validator`** — `signerToEcdsaValidator` wraps the local EIP-7702 signer for the kernel.
- **`@zerodev/smart-routing-address`** — `createSmartRoutingAddress` generates one-time deposit addresses that route funds from any supported chain into Arbitrum USDC / ETH.
- **`permissionless`** — ERC-4337 bundler / user-operation utilities.

### Ethereum tooling
- **`ethers` v6** — `BrowserProvider`, `Contract`, `parseUnits`, `formatUnits` for signer flows and read-only calls.
- **`viem`** — used by ZeroDev packages (chain descriptors like `arbitrum`, `arbitrumSepolia`) and for typed hex encoding.
- **`qrcode.react`** — renders QR codes for Receive Payment and Smart-Routing deposit addresses.

### Backend
- **Supabase** — Postgres + Auth + generated typed client; stores payment requests, contacts and activity.

### On-chain
- **Arbitrum One** (mainnet) and **Arbitrum Sepolia** (testnet). Native USDC address on Arbitrum One: `0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831`.

# ZeroDev Integration Details

### Testnet — creating the 7702 smart account
- On first testnet sign-in an ECDSA signer is generated in the browser and persisted to `localStorage`.
- `signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, { signer, entryPoint, kernelVersion })` from `@zerodev/ecdsa-validator` produces the validator plugin.
- `createKernelAccount(publicClient, { plugins: { sudo: validator }, entryPoint, kernelVersion })` builds the EIP-7702 kernel; the account address stays the same as the user's EOA thanks to the 7702 delegation.
- `createKernelAccountClient({ account, chain: arbitrumSepolia, bundlerTransport: http(BUNDLER_RPC), paymaster: zerodevPaymaster })` wires up sponsored gas so testnet transactions cost the user nothing.
- User operations built through the kernel client are submitted via the ZeroDev bundler; the payer route and activity tracker fall back to raw `eth_sendTransaction` when we need the transfer to show up in Arbiscan's **Transactions** tab rather than **Internal Transactions**.

### Mainnet — Smart Routing for Tourist packages
- `createSmartRoutingAddress` from `@zerodev/smart-routing-address` is called with:
  - `tokenType: 'ERC20'` and the Arbitrum USDC contract for USDC packages, or `tokenType: 'NATIVE'` for ETH packages.
  - `chain: arbitrum` (chain id `42161`) as the destination.
  - A list of `sourceTokens` covering Optimism, Base and Ethereum so users can pay from whichever chain they hold funds on.
  - `allowPartialRoutes: true` so ZeroDev can combine liquidity from multiple sources.
  - `recipient: 0x24A1C7477Bda0BBa179E40Eb9f538fbB719448Fb` — the PayGrid Platform Treasury.
- The returned deposit address is rendered as a QR + copy-able string in a dialog. Any deposit into that address is automatically bridged and delivered as the requested token on Arbitrum One.
- The Universal Account SDK's `createUniversalTransaction({ expectTokens })` provides an analogous smart-sourcing path for the Pay & Split flow, so the user does not need liquidity on Arbitrum specifically.



---

# Technical Overview

## Important Code Snippets

The snippets below are showing how load-bearing pieces of PayGrid — maps directly to a feature described above.

### 1. Bootstrapping the Universal Account (Particle)

Wraps the connected signer (MetaMask EOA or Particle EIP-1193 provider) into a
`UniversalAccount`, exposing `createExecuteTransaction`, `createUniversalTransaction`
and unified balance helpers. Lives in `src/components/ParticleUniversalAccount.tsx`.

```ts
import { UniversalAccount } from "@particle-network/universal-account-sdk";

const ua = new UniversalAccount({
  projectId: PARTICLE_PROJECT_ID,
  clientKey: PARTICLE_CLIENT_KEY,
  appId: PARTICLE_APP_ID,
  signer, // ethers Signer from MetaMask or Particle
});
```

### 2. ZeroDev EIP-7702 kernel client (Testnet)

Builds the smart account on Arbitrum Sepolia with sponsored gas. 

```ts
const validator = await signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, {
  signer,
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
});

const account = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: { sudo: validator },
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
});

const kernelClient = createKernelAccountClient({
  account,
  chain: arbitrumSepolia,
  bundlerTransport: http(BUNDLER_RPC),
  paymaster: zerodevPaymaster,
});

```

### 3. Smart Routing deposit address (Mainnet packages)

Generates a one-time deposit address that auto-bridges USDC / ETH from Optimism,
Base or Ethereum into the PayGrid Treasury on Arbitrum One.

```ts
const routing = await createSmartRoutingAddress({
  tokenType: "ERC20", // or "NATIVE" for ETH packages
  chain: arbitrum,
  sourceTokens: [/* Optimism, Base, Ethereum */],
  allowPartialRoutes: true,
  recipient: "0x24A1C7477Bda0BBa179E40Eb9f538fbB719448Fb",
});
```

### 4. Payer route — raw `eth_sendTransaction` (both networks)

Bypasses ethers v6 gas coercion by submitting the transfer directly through the
EIP-1193 provider. USDC uses manually-encoded `transfer(address,uint256)` calldata.
Lives in `src/routes/pay.$requestId.tsx`.

```ts
await window.ethereum.request({
  method: "eth_sendTransaction",
  params: [{
    from: account,
    to: token === "USDC" ? USDC_ADDRESS : recipient,
    value: token === "ETH" ? toHex(toBaseUnits(amount, 18)) : "0x0",
    data: token === "USDC"
      ? encodeErc20Transfer(recipient, toBaseUnits(amount, 6))
      : "0x",
  }],
});
```
